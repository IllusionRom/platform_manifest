Illusion Source
===================

Getting Started
---------------
To get started with Illusion-Dev sources, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

Submitting Patches to IllusionROM Gerrit
----------------------------------------

First of all you will need to register, set up your SSH and username.
Then you will only need to follow that steps:

1. cd "folder"
That second step must be done on every folder you want to commit to.
2. scp -p -P 29418 (username)@97.81.45.99:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
Now make your changes or cherry-picks. Be sure after editing files there is not example.xml~ , if that files are not deleted they will be added to commit on gerrit.
3. git add -A
4. git commit -m "Commit Message"
5. git push ssh://(username)@97.81.45.99:29418/(project) HEAD:refs/for/4.4


Creating Directories and Installing Repositories
------------------------------------------------

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment:


    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/illusion
    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
    cd ~/illusion
    repo init -u git://github.com/IllusionRom/platform_manifest.git -b 4.4
    repo sync -jx(x=numbers of core, we would recommend to use 4)

Building the System

    . build/envsetup.sh
